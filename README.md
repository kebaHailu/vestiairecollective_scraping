# Web Scraping Code for Extracting Data from Vestiairecollective

## by kibrom Hailu

In this web scraping code, the objective is to extract data from the website **Vestiairecollective**. The code will systematically collect all available links and corresponding data from the site.

Vestiairecollective is an online platform that offers a wide range of fashion items. It is organized into six distinct categories, each representing a specific clothing type or theme. These categories are:

- **Men**: Products for men's fashion.
- **Women**: Products for women's fashion.
- **Kids**: Products for children's fashion.
- **We-love**: A curated selection of trending and popular items.
- **New Items**: Recently added products.
- **Vintage**: Vintage and pre-owned fashion items.

Within each category, there are multiple pages containing product listings. On average, each category has approximately 21 pages. Each page displays 48 product entities, resulting in a substantial amount of data to be extracted.

To achieve this, the web scraping code has been developed with the following functionalities:

1. **Data Extraction**: The code will traverse through the website's categories and pages, capturing information about each product. It will extract details such as the product's name, price, description, and any other relevant attributes.

2. **Data Storage**: The extracted product data will be stored in a structured format for further analysis and utilization. The code will create a file named **data.csv** to store the collected data. This file will serve as a repository for all the extracted information.

3. **Link Extraction**: In addition to product data, the code will also capture and store the links associated with each product. These links provide direct access to the individual product pages on Vestiairecollective. The code will create a file named **links.csv** to store all the collected links. This file will be valuable for future reference and analysis.

4. **Error Handling**: While scraping the website, it's possible to encounter failed or inaccessible links. To account for this, the code will track and record any failed links in a separate file named **failed.csv**. This file will provide a reference for investigating and resolving any issues with the scraping process.

The code is structured with modular functions to handle specific tasks efficiently:

- The `file_handler` function manages file operations, including converting files to lists or dictionaries, and vice versa. It ensures seamless data handling and processing.

- The `manipulate_data` function allows for data manipulation and transformation. It provides flexibility to reorder data, modify prices, or perform any other required data transformations.

- The main file orchestrates the scraping process, utilizing the `store_link` function to collect and store all the necessary links while traversing through the available data.

By implementing this web scraping code, it becomes possible to efficiently extract and organize the desired data from Vestiairecollective, enabling further analysis, insights, and applications related to the fashion industry and e-commerce.
